### Day 1 - Points
**[Challenge Description](https://30daymapchallenge.com/#:~:text=Challenge%20Classic%3A%20Map%20with%20point%20data%20(e.g.%2C%20individual%20locations%2C%20points%20of%20interest%2C%20clusters).%20Focus%20on%20effective%20symbolization%20and%20density%20visualization.):** Visualize point-based data such as individual locations, points of interest, or clusters. Focus on symbolization and density representation.


### My Submission

Maps visualizing **U.S. credit unions**, where each packed circle represents a credit union.  
- **Circle size** corresponds to **member size**.  
- **Circle color** indicates **member growth rate** — blue for higher growth, red for lower or negative growth.
