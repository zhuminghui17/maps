### Day 2 - Lines 
**[Challenge Description](https://30daymapchallenge.com/#:~:text=Challenge%20Classic%3A%20Map%20linear%20features%20(e.g.%2C%20roads%2C%20rivers%2C%20migration%20paths%2C%20flow%20lines).%20Explore%20line%20thickness%2C%20color%2C%20and%20direction%20to%20convey%20information.):** Map linear features (e.g., roads, rivers, migration paths, flow lines). Explore line thickness, color, and direction to convey information.


### My Submission

Driving in Philadelphia feels really different from driving in North Carolina. I didn’t realize there are so many one-way streets, often with opposite directions right next to each other.

I made a map that visualizes **Philadelphia’s street directions**, based on the city’s official *Street Centerlines* dataset.  
Each line segment represents a street block colored by its travel direction:

- 🟦 **One-way (forward)** — typically westbound or southbound  
- 🟥 **One-way (reverse)** — typically eastbound or northbound  
- 🟩 **Two-way**

Two styles (grey and dark) are shown below:
