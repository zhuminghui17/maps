### My Submission

In May 2023, I set out on a solo backpacking trip across 12 European countries. It was my first time exploring Europe on my own, and I made a map (below left) afterward to trace where I’d been.

Two years later, in 2025, I returned to Europe three times to visit my girlfriend while she was studying abroad. Using the same tool, I created another map (below right) to capture those journeys today.

Together, these two maps capture my journeys from both years.

(Overlapping lines represent flight paths I took multiple times.)
